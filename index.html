            -<br>About Me
        </h2>
        <p>
            Currently a 2nd-year student at the University of Ottawa.
            I am majoring in Software Engineering and have taken my 
            career to the next level by participating in events held 
            by universities and by companies like Code in the Dark by 
            OSEDEA. I have participated in 3 hack-a-thons and plan on 
            attending more. I consider my self a person who loves to learn
            and understand concepts. Lessons can be taken anywhere and at any 
            time, I am willing to test my knowledge and to learn where 
            ever and whenever.
